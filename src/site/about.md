On this page you find how to get started with this template, but this
starter is developed as part of a blog article on [`DevZone.one`](https://devzone.one), you find a much more detailed walk-through on:
[**DevZone.one - Get started with Eleventy**](https://devzone.one/posts/get-started-with-eleventy)

## Demo

The lastest version of this template is deployed on:
<https://starter-eleventy.devzoneone.app>
_(**Please note:** The template and the demo only contain a minimum of styling, as that is the purpose of this starter template)_

## How to use the template

Don't fork this repository, that would give you all the branches and
commit history, not what you want.

- **GitHub** If you're going to put your repo on Github, use the green
  `Use this template` button and either directly create a new repo, or
  open a codespace (online IDE). This will copy over all the files but without any git-related history.

## Start developing

1. Install the dependencies:<br>
   `$ npm i`
2. Run locally in watch mode (with html code prettified):<br>
   `$ npm start`
3. Build for production (with html code minified):<br>
   `$ npm run build`
